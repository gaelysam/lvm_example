# lvm_example
This mod, originally written by paramat, serves as a basic example on how to write a performant Lua mapgen containing Perlin noise.

It optionally depends on [`biomegen`](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Gael%20de%20Sailly/biomegen/) which, if present, will decorate the mapgen with biomes and decorations.
